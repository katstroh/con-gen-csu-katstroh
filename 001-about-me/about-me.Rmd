# Who I am and where I came from

I was born and raised in a small farm town in central Oklahoma by two outdoor enthusiasts and national parks nerds. Every family vacation we took was to visit a new park, and I grew up with a deep appreciation for the natural world and all of its diversity. Living in a rural area, I also became very comfortable looking for and catching all manner of critters: toads, snakes, lizards, tarantulas... basically anything that moved I wanted to catch and study.
As I grew older, I began trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life; many people told me that I should be a doctor because I was smart and would make a lot of money, so when I began my undergraduate education at [The University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu) I decided to pursue a B.S. in biology as a pre-med student. After several years studying and volunteering/working in various clinics, I became introduced to the world of herpetological research through a serendipitous enrollment in an elective course that filled the last of my degree requirements. Through my experience in that class I realized that I could make a career out of the very things I loved as a child: being outside and looking for cool animals, and that I could combine that with my training in laboratory techniques and research methods.
After graduating from OU with a dual degree in biology and Spanish I began working as a research and field tech for a herpetology collection in a natural history museum, then decided I wanted to find a job that would allow me to use both my research background and my background in Spanish. I applied for and won a Fulbright Fellowship to research the effects of climate change on amphibians in Ecuador, where I spent a little over a year studying frogs, toads, and caecilians in the Amazon and the Andes mountains. Through my collaborators I became familiar with Chris Funk's work, and reached out to him to see if he would be interested in taking me on as a graduate student to continue the project I had started in Ecuador. We met via Zoom and developed several ideas for expanding my project into a thesis-worthy endeavor, I applied to CSU, was accepted, and am just starting my first semester of classes.

My four favorite activities when I am not chasing herps are:

1. making/eating food (especially desserts)
2. going to concerts
3. traveling
4. anything active and/or outdoors, but particularly lifting weights, hiking, and kayaking

Here is a picture of me learning to climb trees to look for amphibians in bromeliads in the tree canopy.

# Research Interests

Brief description of your research interests.

## Influential papers

Describe two papers that have been very influential in your
research.  The main purpose of this is learning how to
cite literature in RMarkdown.  You will have to add the citations
to `references.bib` in BibTeX format, and then also cite them.

An easy way to get the paper in BibTeX format is to find it on
Google Scholar.  Then, under the paper's link, click on the big 
fat quotation marks, and then choose the BibTex link at the bottom
of the page.  Then copy the contents into `references.bib`.  For example
you might paste this into `references.bib`.
```
@article{richardson1997bayesian,
  title={On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components (with discussion)},
  author={Richardson, Sylvia and Green, Peter J},
  journal={Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: series B (statistical methodology)},
  volume={59},
  number={4},
  pages={731--792},
  year={1997},
  publisher={Wiley Online Library}
}
```
Note the string before the comma on the first line.  That is the cite key.
Once you have done that, you can cite it by including `@richardson1997bayesian`
if you don't want the name in parenthesis, like, "As @richardson1997bayesian introduced in
their landmark paper."  On the other hand, you can use `[@richardson1997bayesian]` if
you do want it all in parentheses, like, "Reversible jump MCMC has been previously applied
to the analysis of mixtures [@richardson1997bayesian]."


## The mathematics behind my research

It is easy to write complex mathematics using a mathematical typesetting
engine called TeX.  Write two displayed equations that are relevant
to your work.  For a quick primer on TeX and LaTeX you can
download [this cheatsheet](https://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf)
and then fiddle with including things between the double dollar signs below:
$$
\cos\theta + i\sin\theta = e^{i\theta}
$$
or here:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = EX
$$

## My computing experience

Describe any experience you have with any programming languages.
Include a snippet of code in two different languages using a
non-evaluated code block.  This can be something you have previously
written, or, if you don't have any, then find and copy a few lines of code
off the web.

## What I hope to get out of this class

Give me a bullet list of three things:

* This
* That
* Another

# Evaluating some R code

Here, please evaluate some R code to make a plot or a figure.
The goal here is just to realize that you can imbed R code
within fenced code blocks and get the output rendered into
the document.
