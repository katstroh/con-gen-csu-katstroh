# Who I am and where I came from

I was born and raised in a small farm town in central Oklahoma by two outdoor enthusiasts and national parks nerds. Every family vacation we took was to visit a new park, and I grew up with a deep appreciation for the natural world and all of its diversity. Living in a rural area, I also became very comfortable looking for and catching all manner of critters: toads, snakes, lizards, tarantulas... basically anything that moved I wanted to catch and study.
As I grew older, I began trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life; many people told me that I should be a doctor because I was smart and would make a lot of money, so when I began my undergraduate education at [The University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu) I decided to pursue a B.S. in biology as a pre-med student. After several years studying and volunteering/working in various clinics, I became introduced to the world of herpetological research through a serendipitous enrollment in an elective course that filled the last of my degree requirements. Through my experience in that class I realized that I could make a career out of the very things I loved as a child: being outside and looking for cool animals, and that I could combine that with my training in laboratory techniques and research methods.
After graduating from OU with a dual degree in biology and Spanish I began working as a research and field tech for a herpetology collection in a natural history museum, then decided I wanted to find a job that would allow me to use both my research background and my background in Spanish. I applied for and won a Fulbright Fellowship to research the effects of climate change on amphibians in Ecuador, where I spent a little over a year studying frogs, toads, and caecilians in the Amazon and the Andes mountains. Through my collaborators I became familiar with Chris Funk's work, and reached out to him to see if he would be interested in taking me on as a graduate student to continue the project I had started in Ecuador. We met via Zoom and developed several ideas for expanding my project into a thesis-worthy endeavor, I applied to CSU, was accepted, and am just starting my first semester of classes.

My four favorite activities when I am not chasing herps are:

1. making/eating food (especially desserts)
2. going to concerts
3. traveling
4. anything active and/or outdoors, but particularly lifting weights, hiking, and kayaking

Here is a picture of me learning to climb trees to look for amphibians in the forest canopy.

# Research Interests

In general, I am interested in disease ecology and the effects of climate change within amphibian and reptile communities. For my thesis research I will be looking at the effects of climate change, habitat fragmentation, and infectious disease on tropical amphibians. I will be doing this across a 4,000-meter elevational gradient from the Amazon basin to the upper Andes in Ecuador, and in the future would like to do a similar project in a temperate region.


## Influential papers

The first paper that has influenced the current direction of my research is @scheele2019amphibian, a paper describing the current (as of 2019) state  of a global panzootic impacting amphibians in all seven continents and precipitating the decline of over 500 species. This paper highlights the importance of amphibian infectious disease research and key regions for investigation. 

I also find my research in Ecuador shaped by an article written by @bustamante2005cambios and describes a study of seven different amphibian communities studied during almost 40 years. My project is very similar to Bustamante et al.'s, but surveys additional sites across a wider range of elevations and occurs 19 years subsequent to the previous study.


## The mathematics behind my research

It is easy to write complex mathematics using a mathematical typesetting
engine called TeX.  Write two displayed equations that are relevant
to your work.  For a quick primer on TeX and LaTeX you can
download [this cheatsheet](https://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf)
and then fiddle with including things between the double dollar signs below:
$$
\cos\theta + i\sin\theta = e^{i\theta}
$$
or here:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = EX
$$

## My computing experience

Describe any experience you have with any programming languages.
Include a snippet of code in two different languages using a
non-evaluated code block.  This can be something you have previously
written, or, if you don't have any, then find and copy a few lines of code
off the web.

## What I hope to get out of this class

Give me a bullet list of three things:

* This
* That
* Another

# Evaluating some R code

Here, please evaluate some R code to make a plot or a figure.
The goal here is just to realize that you can imbed R code
within fenced code blocks and get the output rendered into
the document.
